This is a simple example demonstrating a Spring AOP aspect.

The `@UpperCase` annotation transforms the first `String` argument of a method
to upper case. It also supports specifying a `prefix`. The example `MyService`
interface sets `prefix` to `"Prefix: "` on its `process` method. When
`TransformAspect` intercepts the call, it will prepend this prefix before the
upperâ€‘cased value.

Running `Main` will therefore output something like:

```
Prefix: HELLO WORLD
```
